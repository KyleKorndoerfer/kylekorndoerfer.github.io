### About Kyle

I started my journey in Software Development by playing around with Basic on the
'portable' Compaq computer my father would bring home from work in order to
manage his bowling league in Lotus 1-2-3. In High School I was a part of the
Computer Club where I learned Turbo Basic and Turbo Pascal as well as competing
in the [American Computer Science League (ACSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Computer_Science_League).

After High School I attended the [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://rit.edu)
earning a Bachelors Degree in BioMedical Computing. Armed with this new degree,
I spent the next 15 years working in and around production print systems for
Pitney Bowes Management Services and Xerox primarily developing and supporting
large-scale, full-stack systems written in .NET using C#.

I am currently working on the backend systems supporting the
[Wegmans Meals 2GO](https://meals2go.com) online ordering platform running on
the Azure Cloud.

I am a trained Scrum Master, Scrum Product Owner, and a Lean 6-sigma Green Belt.

For the past 25 years I have also been a licensed Pyrotechnician in the State of
New York with [Young Explosives](https://www.youngexplosives.com/) where I have
managed to keep all of his fingers and toes (sa far)!

I was also the leader of a local user group called Visual Developer of Upstate
New York (VDUNY), later renamed to .NET Rochester, for several years.
